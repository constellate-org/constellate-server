Like all Constellations, this one is generated entirely from a Jupyter notebook: see what that notebook looks like [here].\n\nA Constellation is made up of *stars*, which are rendered as single web pages. There are many different types of stars, but most of them combine some text, as a Markdown cell, with some kind of visual, as a Python cell. Because this is a Markdown cell that isn't followed up by any kind of visual or code, it renders as a standalone Markdown star.",

There should be only one of these per document, ideally in the first Markdown cell.\n - Second-level headings, like `## Document Structure`, define sections. These show up in the table of contents: clicking the link will send you back to this cell.\n - Third-level headings, like `### Sections and Subsections`, define subsections. These only show up in the table of contents when the reader is inside the containing section: you can see \"Sections and Subsections\" inside the table of contents now, but if you go back to the last star it won't appear.",
